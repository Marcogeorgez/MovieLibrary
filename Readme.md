# Movie Library App

## Overview

The Movie Library App is a Windows Forms application developed using C# and ADO.NET.
This self-learning project aims to reinforce concepts in C# programming, object-oriented design, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
The application allows users to manage a personal movie library by performing various operations on movie entries.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new movies to the library with details such as title, seen, release year, and description.
- **Read**: View the list of movies in the library, including detailed information for each movie.
- **Update**: Edit existing movie details to keep the library up-to-date.
- **Delete**: Remove movies from the library when no longer needed.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: The primary programming language used for the application logic.
- **ADO.NET**: Used for data access and manipulation with the database.
- **WinForms**: Provides the graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the movie library.


## Reason to Learn ADO.Net:
- Since Entity Framework is built on ADO.Net , many aspects including errors can be related to ADO.Net and therefore it is essential to know a knowledge about ADO .Net.
- Reinforce Learning SQL in the meantime.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 or later
